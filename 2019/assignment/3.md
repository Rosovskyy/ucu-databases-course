## Intoduction
The goal of this assignment is build a web application with set of REST APIs 
around the database, which you have created in the previous assignments.

## Conventions

This assignment will be tested by automated functional tests, therefore all 
your  actions in the database (table creation, user creation, insert, update) 
should be reflected in the corresponding `.sql` files. I recommend you to 
use the same environment (MySQL 5.7) when doing this assignment to ensure the 
compatibility of your results with the testing environment.

## Recommendations

Each practical assignment could contain some information not covered in lectures. 
But this should not stop you from its fulfillment. I encourage you to use Google 
to fill gaps in your practical knowledge. However, to reduce 
ambiguity between different information sources, I have added a list of 
recommended links with hints for each unknown point at the end of the assignment. 
It is no shame to use it, but first try to find information by yourself.

If you have any issues with this assignment, please reach me or course assistant 
Mykhailo Poliakov. Feel free to use the course Slack channel to ask questions and 
help your colleagues. If you have any new ideas or improvements, please to send 
pull-request to repository [ucu-databases-course](https://github.com/tsdaemon/ucu-databases-course). Your colleagues will be grateful if you make these instructions better.

## Instructions

In previous assignment, you have decomposed your data into 6 tables: 
`pets, cohorts, transport_types, assignments, students, 
student_assignments`, and created a view `student_summary`. 
In current assignment, each table and a view will be a 
[resource](https://restful-api-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources.html) for 
a single REST API in your application. Therefore, in total you will implement 
a web application with 7 APIs.

### Template

I have prepared for you a template of web application, which you can use as a 
start point. To prepare it, run: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsdaemon/ucu-databases-course
cd ucu-databases-course/2019/hw3boilerplate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In this folder you can start you solution. This template has a simple structure:

1. File `start.py` - main entry point of your application.
2. Folder `sql` - folder with scripts to create your database.
3. Folder `students` - example of REST API structure for resource \code{students}.

To test it, run the application: 

```bash
python start.py
```

The result should be something like:

```bash
 * Serving Flask app "start" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

With `curl` you can check that route `students` is available and returns status 
code 501 Not Implemented: 

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/students
```

### SQL
I need SQL scripts from your previous assignments to create database structure 
in the test environment. Copy your scripts from your previous assignments into 
folder `sql`:

1. `db.sql` - database and user definition from HW1.
2. `tables.sql` - tables structure from HW2.
3. `student_summary.sql` - `student_summary` view from HW2.

### Read-write REST API

Each read-write REST API should implement 5 endpoints:

1. Get all records from the table (`GET /`).
2. Get a single record by `id` (`GET /<int:id>`).
3. Create a new record (`POST /`).
4. Update an existsing record (`PUT /`).
5. Delete an existsing record (`DELETE /<int:id>`).

## Submission

In your submission you should include file `start.py`, all other python files imported 
in it, and the folder `sql`. 

To submit your solution, pack all files in a single **zip** archive. 
Submit it on assignment page in CMS. After a successful solution upload, you
will get a link to the CircleCI build page. 

**Please test your solution carefully before submission!**

I give you credit for *one* submission fail. This means, if your test fails, 
I will reach to you and explain the error, so you can correct your 
solution, and resubmit it one time without a penalty. All the following 
submission failures  will be penalized.

If you have any issues or errors during submission, please contact me or 
Mykhailo Poliakov.
